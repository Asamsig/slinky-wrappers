# slinky-wrappers

These are wrappers that I'm writing for my own projects. Currently, there's somewhat more support for Material UI than Semantic UI. There's an example using it here: https://github.com/hejfelix/wishr

There are some things which are very difficult to model using Scala's type system. Many of these problems could potentially be fixed by Dotty (singleton types, intersection-/unition types, proper enums). 

Furthermore, the intellij support is not (IMHO) amazing when using the @react macro. Hence, I'm not too busy with this project.
